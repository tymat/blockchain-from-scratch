//! In this section our client will begin maintaining a transaction pool.
//!
//! The transaction pool is where transactions that are not yet included in the blockchain
//! are queued before they are inserted into blocks.
//!
//! Maintaining a transaction pool includes:
//! * Accepting transactions from users
//! * Removing transactions that are included in blocks as they are imported
//! * Making the current transactions available for a block authoring process
//! * Re-queueing transactions from orphaned blocks when re-orgs happen (This one happens IRL; might not cover it in BFS; TBD)
