//! As a blockchain node watches the chain evolve, it must constantly be assessing which chain
//! is currently the best chain. We explored the concept of fork-choice briefly in the Blockchain chapter.
//!
//! The concepts are identical here, but now that we have a client tracking a proper block database,
//! we can explore more advanced fork choice algorithms. In particular, we can now explore GHOST.
